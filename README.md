My motivation to with this project was to see if we could use it to make our group project: Movie Nights

I built this project with the intention of learning more about implementing API's but more importantly to create a site that would allow the user to search for movies giving access to the movies' name, year of release, and poster. Providing a link to the trailer by clicking on the poster.

The problem this project and ultimately our project Movie Nights will hope to solve is to allow someone to create a list of movies they may like to watch, and providing a visual aide allowing them a better way of choosing a movie to watch on a movie night

I learned a lot during this project, mainly about how fetching needs to be approached and how it effects any function that comes after it. It took me a while just to get past the fetching portion, but I also learned some good ways of handling multiple functions that are meant to work well with each other.

I think what makes my project stand out is how cleanly the code runs and how the styling of each query comes out to be very visually digestable. The styling wasn't the main focus of this project however, mainly the functionality of the search and placement of queries.
